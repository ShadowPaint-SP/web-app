While some studies have found positive effects such as the decrease in rents by an average of 8% in Berlin, other studies have found negative effects, including a decrease in the supply of rental housing and an increase in rents for new apartments.\n\nTherefore, it is important to conduct further research and consult trusted sources to fully understand the impact of the mietendeckel before making any conclusive statements on its effectiveness. As of now, the policy remains controversial and has been declared unconstitutional by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court.",

Several studies, including those by the ifo institute, pwc, and immoscout24, have found that the rent cap did not have a significant impact on rental prices and may have even led to an increase in prices for new rental contracts. Furthermore, the rent cap may have had negative economic effects on the housing market in Berlin, such as reducing the supply of rental housing and decreasing the profitability of new construction projects. It is worth noting, however, that one study by immoscout24 did find an average decrease of 8% in rental prices, though this decrease was more pronounced in wealthier neighborhoods. \n\nBy conducting further research and consulting trusted sources, it seems that the claim that the rent cap in Berlin does not work has some basis in reality. While there may be some minor exceptions, such as the decrease in rental prices in some neighborhoods found by immoscout24, the overall impact of the rent cap appears to have been negative. It is important to continue evaluating the effectiveness of policies such as the rent cap and making informed decisions based on evidence and data.",

Putin's use of propaganda has been described as sophisticated and manipulative, often involving a mix of true and false information to gain support both domestically and internationally. Some tech giants are even taking steps to curate Russian content on their platforms due to the prevalence of pro-Putin propaganda publications.\n\nIn addition, Putin's \"gay propaganda\" law is an example of political homophobia used for political gain, further demonstrating his willingness to use propaganda for his own benefit. While the search results do not explicitly confirm the original claim, the evidence suggests that it is likely true that Putin spreads propaganda worldwide to maintain his power. It is important to continue seeking information from trusted sources to uncover the truth behind political propaganda.",

The exoplanet is known as HIP 65426 b, and it was first discovered in 2017 using the Sphere instrument on the European Southern Observatory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Very Large Telescope. However, the James Webb Telescope's view provides new details that ground-based telescopes cannot see. The planet is a gas giant with no rocky surface, and it is nearly the same size as Earth. The telescope captured the image of the exoplanet in four different bands of infrared light using small masks that block bright light from the exoplanet's host star.\n\nIn summary, it is true that the James Webb Space Telescope has taken the first-ever direct image of a planet outside our solar system. By conducting further research and relying on trusted sources, we can conclude that the claim is true. This achievement opens the next chapter in understanding the variety of worlds in the universe and provides more information about the composition and formation of exoplanets.",

Discrimination in any form is not acceptable and goes against ethical principles and values that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. By focusing on these principles and values, we can work towards a more just and equitable society that respects human dignity and rights for all individuals.",
